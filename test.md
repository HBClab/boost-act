testing so i can get better at this.
its starting to work, still need a lot of practice

# this is title

this is me learning without looking, its honestly kind of hard

this is kinda crazy like wtf

i wonder if i spend all day doing this if i will get any better, probably not...

but hey lets see what happens lol

This happens to be more difficult than i imagined. this will definitely take a while to get used to. but i am all for it. its teaching me how to type the right way


doing some more testing, its still very hard for me to do this

lets seeeee so if i dont look at the keyboard its kinda hard still but i think its helping because i'm getting the muscle memory

a lot of typing is going to have to happen today if i want to be able to use this tomorrow

its starting to get a little easier but there are still some keys that i need to work on. specifically the corner keys because having the split makes the corner keys naturally more difficult

its starting to take less time for me to type these lines but i am still having trouble with the corner keys and also the space key...

i am really liking the feel of the keyboard tho, its smooth, ergo, and lots of fun to play with, but is definitely a big learning curve for me since i never really typed right in the first place

i can still keep just typing the things that come into my head to keep learning.

i just moved the keyboards a little closer together because i think it might be a little easier this way

apparently if i remove the TTRS cable without first unplugging the usb-c cable some bad shit can happen
